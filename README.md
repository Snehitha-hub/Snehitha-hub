### 📦 Highlight Projects

#### 🔹 **1. Cloud Data Pipeline (AWS Glue + Redshift)**
Designed a serverless ETL workflow that processed 50M+ rows daily:
- Automated ingestion from S3 → transformation via AWS Glue → loading into Redshift.
- Added Airflow DAGs for scheduling and error notifications via SNS.
- Achieved 30% runtime reduction through partitioning and parallelism.

#### 🔹 **2. Streaming Data Framework (Kafka + PySpark + S3)**
- Built an event-driven data ingestion pipeline with Kafka producers and PySpark consumers.
- Implemented checkpointing and window aggregations for near real-time insights.
- Integrated with S3 data lake and Athena for ad-hoc analysis.

#### 🔹 **3. Data Quality & Validation Framework**
- Developed a Python-based validation tool for ETL pipelines.
- Compared record counts, schema mismatches, and transformation accuracy across environments.
- Generated automated email reports for stakeholders.
